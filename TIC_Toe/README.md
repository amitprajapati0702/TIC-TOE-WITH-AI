- **Winning line animations** that highlight the winning combination
- **Turn indicators** showing whose turn it is
- **Game result modals** with celebration animations
- **Local storage** to save scores and theme preferences

### 🎵 Enhanced Experience
- **Visual feedback** for all interactions
- **Smooth animations** for moves and game states
- **Hover effects** and button animations
- **AI thinking indicator** with animation

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Open the game** by opening `index.html` in your web browser
2. **Choose your difficulty level** from the dropdown menu
3. **Select a theme** that you like
4. **Click on any empty square** to make your move (you are X)
5. **Watch the AI respond** with its move (AI is O)
6. **Try to get three in a row** horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
7. **Challenge yourself** with different difficulty levels!

## 🧠 AI Algorithm Explanation

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning**:

### Minimax Algorithm
- Evaluates all possible future game states
- Assumes both players play optimally
- Chooses the move that maximizes AI's chances while minimizing player's chances

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Optimizes the Minimax algorithm by eliminating unnecessary branches
- Significantly reduces computation time
- Maintains the same optimal result with better performance

### Scoring System
- **AI Win**: +10 points (minus depth for faster wins)
- **Player Win**: -10 points (plus depth to delay losses)
- **Draw**: 0 points
