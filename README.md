## 🧠 How the AI Works

This isn't random move-picking. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, ensuring it either wins or forces a draw — there's no fooling it!

**Minimax** is a recursive algorithm used for decision-making in game theory:
- It simulates all possible moves
- Evaluates the best/worst-case outcomes
- Picks the optimal move based on the current board state
